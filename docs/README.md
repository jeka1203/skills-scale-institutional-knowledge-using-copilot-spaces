# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation! This README serves as your central entry point for understanding how OctoAcme runs projects, manages delivery, and collaborates across teams.

## 📋 Overview

The OctoAcme project management methodology is designed to help cross-functional teams deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently and effectively. Our approach is built on five core principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage open feedback and continuous learning

### Purpose

Our project management framework provides a concise, shareable approach that helps new teammates quickly understand our roles, processes, and key artifacts. It applies to all cross-functional projects across OctoAcme.

### Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and verify acceptance criteria are met
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, requirements, and approvals

### Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams create and maintain these essential documents:

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow a structured lifecycle with clear decision gates:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, create high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break down scope, estimate resources, define milestones and dependencies
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on deliverables
4. **Release**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce to stakeholders
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, document outcomes, and identify improvements

### Communication Cadence

Consistent communication keeps everyone aligned:

- **Weekly sync** between PM and PdM
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery team (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** on progress and key metrics
- **Ad-hoc escalations** for urgent issues or blockers

## 📚 Process Documentation

### 1. Project Management Overview
**[octoacme-project-management-overview.md](octoacme-project-management-overview.md)**

Provides a comprehensive introduction to OctoAcme's project management approach, including our principles, core roles, key artifacts, and communication cadence. Start here if you're new to OctoAcme or need a refresher on our methodology.

### 2. Project Initiation
**[octoacme-project-initiation.md](octoacme-project-initiation.md)**

Learn how to validate and authorize new work through the initiation process. This guide covers creating a Project One-pager, identifying stakeholders, defining success criteria, and making go/no-go decisions. Key deliverables include the problem statement, stakeholder list, high-level timeline, and initial risk assessment.

### 3. Project Planning
**[octoacme-project-planning.md](octoacme-project-planning.md)**

Transform approved initiatives into actionable plans. This document walks you through breaking work into shippable increments, creating prioritized backlogs with acceptance criteria, estimating scope, defining your Definition of Done, and building release plans. Essential for kickoffs and sprint planning.

### 4. Execution & Tracking
**[octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)**

Guidance for managing day-to-day execution and tracking progress toward milestones. Covers team rhythm (standups, syncs, demos), workflows (PR conventions, board management), quality practices (testing, security scanning), reporting metrics, and blocker escalation paths.

### 5. Risk Management & Communication
**[octoacme-risks-and-communication.md](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md)**

Explains how to identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks throughout the project lifecycle. Includes the Risk Register format, stakeholder communication templates, weekly status updates, incident communication protocols, and escalation paths for different scenarios.

### 6. Release & Deployment
**[octoacme-release-and-deployment.md](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)**

Standardizes how OctoAcme releases features to production to reduce risk and improve observability. Covers release types (patch, minor, major), pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, smoke testing, rollback procedures, and release notes templates.

### 7. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
**[octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)**

Learn how to capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements. Includes retrospective structure and timing, facilitation guidance, action item templates, and approaches for tracking improvements and building a continuous improvement culture.

### 8. Roles & Personas
**[octoacme-roles-and-personas.md](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)**

Detailed definitions of typical roles and responsibilities in OctoAcme projects. Provides role summaries, key responsibilities, goals, and communication patterns for Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers. Useful for understanding team dynamics and role boundaries.
